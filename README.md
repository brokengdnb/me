## Support

## Errors

> Packaging app for platform win32 x64 using electron v8.0.3
Could not find "wine64" on your system.

###Â PLAN A:
```bash
brew install homebrew/cask-versions/wine-devel
```

> Error: Cask 'wine-devel' requires XQuartz/X11, which can be installed using Homebrew Cask by running:

```bash
brew cask install xquartz
```

> rcedit.exe failed with exit code null.
>> ...that was critical hit and I start compile that from source code

### PLAN B:

[Follow white rabbit and good luck!](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/376427 "Follow white rabbit and good luck!")

> checking whether bison is recent enough... no
configure: error: Your bison version is too old.
Please install bison version 3.0 or newer.

```bash
brew install bison
brew link bison --force

# Warning: Refusing to link macOS-provided software: bison
echo 'export PATH="/usr/local/opt/bison/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bash_profile

# For compilers to find bison you may need to set:
export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/bison/lib"
```
